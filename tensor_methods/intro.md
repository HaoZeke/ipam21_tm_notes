# Tensor Methods and Emerging Applications to the Physical and Data Sciences
## About
This is a short collection of code snippets and other notes collected over the course of the [IPAM 2021 long program](http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/long-programs/tensor-methods-and-emerging-applications-to-the-physical-and-data-sciences/?tab=overview) on tensor methods and their applications.

## Structure
Each of the four workshops (and the tutorials) have been divided into notes and code snippets.

### Lectures

By and large the lecture notes are either verbatim or based on the slides. The only real benefit to viewing them here is the ability to use the references.

### Code

This section contains relevant / tangentially related code snippets which are written primarily in `python`.
