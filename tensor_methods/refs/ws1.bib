  abstract = {We present time-dependent density matrix renormalization group simulations (t-DMRG) at finite temperatures. It is demonstrated how a combination of finite-temperature t-DMRG and time-series prediction allows for an easy and very accurate calculation of spectral functions in one-dimensional quantum systems, irrespective of their statistics for arbitrary temperatures. This is illustrated with spin structure factors of XX and XXX spin-12 chains. For the XX model we can compare against an exact solution, and for the XXX model (Heisenberg antiferromagnet) against a Bethe ansatz solution and quantum Monte Carlo data.},

BaOsO\$\_3\$ has 4 electrons in the t\$\_\{2g\}\$ shell akin to ruthenates but stronger spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and is thus expected to reveal an interplay of Hund's metal behavior with SOC. We explore the paramagnetic phase diagram as a function of SOC and Hubbard interaction strengths, identifying metallic, band (van-Vleck) insulating and Mott insulating regions. At the physical values of the two couplings we find that BaOsO\$\_3\$ is still situated inside the metallic region and has a moderate quasiparticle renormalization \$m\^*/m \textbackslash approx 2\$; consistent with specific heat measurements. SOC plays an important role in suppressing electronic correlations (found in the vanishing SOC case) through the splitting of a van-Hove singularity (vHs) close to the Fermi energy, but is insufficient to push the material into an insulating van-Vleck regime. In spite of the strong effect of SOC, BaOsO\$\_3\$ can be best pictured as a moderately correlated Hund's metal.},

This can be achieved at virtually no cost, and in sharp contrast to existing methods based on the dampening of the moments, improves the spectral resolution rather than lowering it. We validate the method for the exactly solvable resonating level model and the single impurity Anderson model. It is capable of resolving sharp Kondo resonances, as well as peaks within the Hubbard bands when employed as an impurity solver for dynamical mean-field theory. Our method works at zero temperature and allows for arbitrary discretization of the bath spectrum. It achieves similar precision as the dynamical density matrix renormalization group, at lower cost. We also propose an alternative expansion, of 1-exp(-{$\tau$}H) instead of the usual H, which opens the possibility of using established methods for the time evolution of matrix product states to calculate the spectral functions directly.},

For the single-band model, we observe sharp features at the inner edges of the Hubbard bands. A finite-size scaling shows that they remain present in the thermodynamic limit. We analyze the real time-dependence of the double occupation after adding a single electron and observe oscillations at the same energy as the sharp feature in the Hubbard band, indicating a long-lived coherent superposition of states that correspond to the Kondo peak and the side peaks. For a two-band Hubbard model, we observe an even richer structure in the Hubbard bands, which cannot be related to a multiplet structure of the impurity, in addition to sharp excitations at the band edges of a type similar to the single-band case.},

It extends the standard mean-field construction from classical statistical mechanics to quantum problems. We discuss the physical ideas underlying this theory and its mathematical derivation. Various analytic and numerical techniques that have been developed recently in order to analyze and solve the dynamical mean-field equations are reviewed and compared to each other. The method can be used for the determination of phase diagrams (by comparing the stability of various types of long-range order), and the calculation of thermodynamic properties, one-particle Green's functions, and response functions. We review in detail the recent progress in understanding the Hubbard model and the Mott metal-insulator transition within this approach, including some comparison to experiments on three-dimensional transition-metal oxides. We present an overview of the rapidly developing field of applications of this method to other systems. The present limitations of the approach, and possible extensions of the formalism are finally discussed.

  abstract = {The solution of parameter-dependent linear systems, by classical methods, leads to an arithmetic effort that grows exponentially in the number of parameters. This renders the multigrid method, which has a well understood convergence theory, infeasible. A parameter-dependent representation, e.g., a low-rank tensor format, can avoid this exponential dependence, but in these it is unknown how to calculate the inverse directly within the representation. The combination of these representations with the multigrid method requires a parameter-dependent version of the classical multigrid theory and a parameter-dependent representation of the linear system, the smoother, the prolongation and the restriction. A derived parameter-dependent version of the smoothing property, fulfilled by parameter-dependent versions of the Richardson and Jacobi methods, together with the approximation property prove the convergence of the multigrid method for arbitrary parameter-dependent representations. For a model problem low-rank tensor formats represent the parameter-dependent linear system, prolongation and restriction. The smoother, a damped Jacobi method, is directly approximated in the low-rank tensor format by using exponential sums. Proving the smoothing property for this approximation guarantees the convergence of the parameter-dependent method. Numerical experiments for the parameter-dependent model problem, with bounded parameter value range, indicate a grid size independent convergence rate.},

We take the full Hubbard-Kanamori interactions and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) into account. The MPS impurity solver works at essentially zero temperature in the presence of SOC, a regime of parameters currently inaccessible to continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo methods, due to a severe sign problem. We show that earlier results obtained at high temperature, namely, that the diagonal self-energies are nearly unaffected by SOC and that interactions lead to an effective enhancement of the SOC, hold even at low temperature. We observe that realism makes the numerical solution of the impurity model with MPS much more demanding in comparison to earlier works on Bethe lattice models, requiring several algorithmic improvements.},

  abstract = {This review presents a summary and evaluation of the experimental properties of unconventional superconductivity in Sr2RuO4 as they were known in the spring of 2002. At the same time, the paper is intended to be useful as an introduction to the physics of spin-triplet superconductivity. First, the authors show how the normal-state properties of Sr2RuO4 are quantitatively described in terms of a quasi-two-dimensional Fermi liquid. Then they summarize its phenomenological superconducting parameters in the framework of the Ginzburg-Landau model, and discuss the existing evidence for spin-triplet pairing. After a brief introduction to the vector order parameter, they examine the most likely symmetry of the triplet state. The structure of the superconducting energy gap is discussed, as is the effect of symmetry-breaking magnetic fields on the phase diagram. The article concludes with a discussion of some outstanding issues and desirable future work. Appendixes on additional details of the normal state, difficulty in observing the bulk Fermi surface by angle-resolved photoemission, and the enhancement of superconducting transition temperature in a two-phase Sr2RuO4-Ru system are included.},

  abstract = {We explore the interplay of electron-electron correlations and spin-orbit coupling in the model Fermi liquid Sr2RuO4 using laser-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Our precise measurement of the Fermi surface confirms the importance of spin-orbit coupling in this material and reveals that its effective value is enhanced by a factor of about 2, due to electronic correlations. The self-energies for the {$\beta$} and {$\gamma$} sheets are found to display significant angular dependence. By taking into account the multi-orbital composition of quasiparticle states, we determine self-energies associated with each orbital component directly from the experimental data. This analysis demonstrates that the perceived angular dependence does not imply momentum-dependent many-body effects but arises from a substantial orbital mixing induced by spin-orbit coupling. A comparison to single-site dynamical mean-field theory further supports the notion of dominantly local orbital self-energies and provides strong evidence for an electronic origin of the observed nonlinear frequency dependence of the self-energies, leading to ``kinks'' in the quasiparticle dispersion of Sr2RuO4.},

This converges the self-consistency loop on the imaginary-frequency axis and obtains real-frequency information in a final real-time evolution. Relative to computations on the real-frequency axis, required bath sizes are much smaller and no entanglement is generated, so much larger systems can be studied. The power of the method is demonstrated by solutions of a three-band model in the single- and two-site dynamical mean-field approximation. Technical issues are discussed, including details of the method, efficiency as compared to other matrix-product-state-based impurity solvers, bath construction and its relation to real-frequency computations and the analytic continuation problem of quantum Monte Carlo methods, the choice of basis in dynamical cluster approximation, and perspectives for off-diagonal hybridization functions.},

We show that the star geometry of the underlying impurity problem can have substantially better entanglement properties than the previously favored chain geometry. This has immense consequences for the efficiency of an MPS-based description of general impurity problems: in the case of equilibrium DMFT, it leads to an orders-of-magnitude speedup. We introduce an approximation for the two-time hybridization function that uses time-translational invariance, which can be observed after a certain relaxation time after a quench to a time-independent Hamiltonian.},

  abstract = {The topology of the Fermi surface of Sr2RuO4 is well described by local-density approximation calculations with spin-orbit interaction, but the relative size of its different sheets is not. By accounting for many-body effects via dynamical mean-field theory, we show that the standard isotropic Coulomb interaction alone worsens or does not correct this discrepancy. In order to reproduce experiments, it is essential to account for the Coulomb anisotropy. The latter is small but has strong effects; it competes with the Coulomb-enhanced spin-orbit coupling and the isotropic Coulomb term in determining the Fermi surface shape. Its effects are likely sizable in other correlated multiorbital systems. In addition, we find that the low-energy self-energy matrix\textemdash responsible for the reshaping of the Fermi surface\textemdash sizably differs from the static Hartree-Fock limit. Finally, we find a strong spin-orbital entanglement; this supports the view that the conventional description of Cooper pairs via factorized spin and orbital part might not apply to Sr2RuO4.},
